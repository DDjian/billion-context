/**
 * Anonymous prefix-affinity session resolution (#309, replaces the #286
 * content-fingerprint 400 for clients that cannot send any identity).
 *
 * Stateless clients (dsh web, third-party harnesses) replay their FULL
 * conversation history on every request. That replay itself is a stable
 * identity signal: hash the message list into an append-only chain
 * (h_i = sha256(h_{i-1} || msg_i)) and resolve the request to the session
 * whose stored chain is the LONGEST strict prefix of the incoming chain.
 *
 * This mirrors vLLM/SGLang radix prefix caching, lifted from KV-block reuse
 * to the identity layer. The crucial difference from the removed
 * content-fingerprint (#286 hashed the FIRST user message — a permanent
 * collision anchor): a prefix match degrades gracefully — two conversations
 * sharing an opening only share a session until they diverge, then the
 * divergent request no longer matches the stored chain and forks into its
 * own session (self-healing, at most one transient merged turn).
 *
 * Semantics that cannot be avoided without client ids: a fork (edited or
 * diverged history sharing a prefix) rejoins the session of the branch that
 * most recently extended it. Two truly distinct conversations merge only
 * while byte-identical.
 *
 * Partitioning — deliberately absent (#286 lesson): protocol, upstream
 * origin and credentials are all MUTABLE MID-CONVERSATION (bearer rotation,
 * relay switching, protocol-translating relays). Partitioning by them orphans
 * state exactly when the user keeps talking. The content chain is the only
 * immutable anchor: the same person switching keys or relays mid-conversation
 * keeps the session, which is the correct semantics.
 *
 * Matching is HEAD-ANCHORED ONLY. A client that TRUNCATED its replayed
 * history does not reattach the stored chain — it forks into a fresh session
 * (birth attributed via lineage, see resolve step 2). The former
 * "tail-window reattach" (#316) adopted sessions on a contiguous MID-CHAIN
 * match, which is symmetric evidence: it cannot distinguish "same
 * conversation, truncated replay" from "a different conversation quoting
 * shared content" (templated tool outputs, standard files, stock errors —
 * parallel agents on one codebase produce these naturally). Removed in
 * #1115; rejected alternatives are documented in SESSION-IDENTITY.md.
 *
 * Safety: matching a stored chain requires holding a byte-identical HEAD, so
 * the folded state reveals nothing the requester does not already hold.
